# transition-composition

This is a small library i made to help me out with transition composition.
This is WIP and does the bare essentials to be usable.

Currently works for css only.

Everything under the folder `custom-svelte-transitions` is used for transition composition.

Aside from transition composition, this library also allows you to chain *filter effect transitions*, because they all have to be in the same transition applied under the *css filter attribute*.
